Branching test

Unstable changes:
- Try out something very risky
	- This turned out to be a pretty stable feature, moving on...
	- Gonna commit this to develop and afterwards to a new release!
	- After I work on more stuff, of course..
	- Added new feature here: a new line.. very original!

A new section over here:
- More cool stuff exclusively develop branch!
	- Well, until we merge it into a release branch...
	- Afterwards, it will sit there without any new, cool features.
	- Only bugs will be hunted and fixed!
	- After we'll make the release, we'll need to merge back any bugfixes into the develop tree.
